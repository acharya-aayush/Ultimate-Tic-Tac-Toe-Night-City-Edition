# Ultimate Tic Tac Toe - Night City Edition Documentation

## Overview
Ultimate Tic Tac Toe (Night City Edition) is an advanced version of the classic Tic Tac Toe game with a cyberpunk theme inspired by the world of Night City. The game features a 3x3 grid of smaller 3x3 Tic Tac Toe boards, creating a meta-game where winning three small boards in a line secures overall victory.

## Game Mechanics

### Basic Rules
1. **Board Structure**: The game consists of a 3x3 grid of smaller 3x3 Tic Tac Toe boards (9 small boards in total).
2. **Player Turn**: Players alternate turns placing their marker (X or O) on one of the small boards.
3. **Board Selection**: After a player makes a move, the next player must play in the small board corresponding to the cell position of the previous move.
4. **Free Move**: If a player is directed to a board that is already won or full, they may play in any available board.
5. **Winning Small Boards**: Win a small board by getting three of your markers in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
6. **Winning the Game**: Win the overall game by winning three small boards in a row.
7. **Draw**: The game ends in a draw if all small boards are either won or drawn and no player has three in a row.

### Game Modes
- **Player vs Player**: Local 2-player mode
- **Player vs AI**: Play against AI opponents of varying difficulty:
  - Royce (Easy)
  - Goro (Medium)
  - Adam Smasher (Hard)
  - Aayush Acharya (Extreme)

### AI Implementation Details

#### Aayush Acharya AI (Extreme Difficulty)
The Aayush Acharya AI uses an advanced strategic approach with a multi-tier decision-making process:

1. **Strategic Prioritization**:
   - **Priority 1**: Win the current board if possible
   - **Priority 2**: Block opponent's winning moves
   - **Priority 3**: Force opponent to disadvantageous boards
   - **Priority 4**: Apply sophisticated heuristic evaluation

2. **Technical Implementation**:
   - **findPriorityMove()**: Instantly identifies winning and blocking opportunities
   - **evaluateSendToBadBoard()**: Evaluates whether a move sends opponent to a disadvantageous board
   - **makeStrategicMove()**: Provides fast decision-making for complex positions
   - **evaluateBoardQuality()**: Assesses the strategic value of sending opponent to a specific board
   - **getStrategicBoardBonus()**: Assigns value to strategically important boards (center, corners)
   - **getStrategicCellBonus()**: Evaluates cells that create winning opportunities at the meta-board level

3. **Search Algorithm**:
   - Enhanced minimax with alpha-beta pruning
   - Dynamic search depth adjustment based on position complexity
   - Cell move ordering optimization to improve pruning efficiency
   - Time-limited search to ensure responsive gameplay

4. **Heuristic Evaluation**:
   - Board control assessment
   - Meta-game strategic evaluation
   - Win pattern detection on both small boards and the meta-board
   - Progressive board analysis that considers forcing moves

5. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Smart fallback for complex positions with many options
   - Prioritized evaluation of critical moves
   - Time-limited computation to ensure responsive gameplay

### AI Move Logging System

The Aayush AI includes a comprehensive move logging system designed to record, analyze, and export detailed information about the AI's decision-making process. This system aids in AI development and could support future machine learning improvements.

1. **Logging Functionality**:
   - **Move Action Classification**: Each move is classified by type (WIN, BLOCK, FORCE_BAD_BOARD, META_WIN_SETUP, HEURISTIC, FALLBACK)
   - **Detailed Reasoning**: Records specific reasoning for each move (e.g., "Blocking opponent's horizontal pattern on board 4")
   - **Numerical Scoring**: Assigns a normalized score (0-10 scale) to reflect move quality
   - **Board and Cell Tracking**: Records source board, target cell, and where the opponent is sent
   - **Sequential Numbering**: Tracks move sequence for reconstructing game flow

2. **Data Formats**:
   - **Console Output**: Real-time move details are logged to the console for debugging
   - **JSON Export**: Structured data format for machine learning and advanced analysis
   - **CSV Export**: Tabular format for spreadsheet analysis and data visualization
   
3. **Sample Move Log Entry**:
   ```json
   {
     "moveNumber": 23,
     "action": "BLOCK",
     "boardFrom": 7,
     "cellChosen": 2,
     "sentOpponentTo": 2,
     "reason": "Blocking opponent's horizontal pattern on board 7",
     "score": 9.8,
     "timestamp": 1623456789000
   }
   ```

4. **Export Interface**:
   - **UI Button**: Accessible via the ðŸ“Š button in the game controls
   - **Format Options**: Choose between JSON or CSV output
   - **Preview Feature**: View recent moves before exporting
   - **Download Function**: Generates downloadable file for offline analysis

5. **Future Applications**:
   - Training supervised machine learning models
   - Feeding game data to reinforcement learning algorithms
   - Analyzing strategic patterns and move tendencies
   - Benchmarking AI performance against human players

6. **Implementation Details**:
   - **logAndExportMove()**: Core function that processes and formats move data
   - **identifyWinPattern()**: Determines specific patterns in winning or blocking moves
   - **evaluateMetaWinSetup()**: Identifies moves that set up winning patterns on the meta-board
   - **Global Access**: Data available via window.aayushMoveLog and window.aayushMoveCSV
   - **Export API**: Functions like window.downloadAayushMoveLog() for programmatic access

### Constants (js/utils/constants.js)
- **INITIAL_STATE**: Initial game state
- **AVATAR_PATHS**: Paths to player and AI avatars
- **CHARACTER_NAMES**: Names for all characters
- **WIN_PATTERNS**: Winning patterns for boards
- **initGlobalState()**: Initializes global state

### Audio System (audio.js)
