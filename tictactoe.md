### Key Code Snippets

#### AI Decision Making
```javascript
function calculateBestMove(board, difficulty) {
  if (difficulty === 'easy') {
    return getRandomValidMove(board);
  } else if (difficulty === 'medium') {
    // 40% chance of making a strategic move, 60% random
    return Math.random() < 0.4 ? 
      findStrategicMove(board) : getRandomValidMove(board);
  } else {
    // Hard: Evaluate board positions and choose best move
    return findOptimalMove(board);
  }
}
```

#### Win Detection Logic
```javascript
function checkWin(board, player) {
  // Check rows, columns, and diagonals
  for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    // Check rows
    if (board[i*3] === player && board[i*3+1] === player && board[i*3+2] === player) {
      return {winner: player, line: `row-${i}`};
    }
    // Check columns
    if (board[i] === player && board[i+3] === player && board[i+6] === player) {
      return {winner: player, line: `col-${i}`};
    }
  }
  
  // Check diagonals
  if (board[0] === player && board[4] === player && board[8] === player) {
    return {winner: player, line: 'diag-1'};
  }
  if (board[2] === player && board[4] === player && board[6] === player) {
    return {winner: player, line: 'diag-2'};
  }
  
  return null;
}
```
